### Description

To make those 3D stereograms.

Some people know these by their commercial form of magic eye.

Just load a picture, a pattern, and click generate.

And like magic a picture with your hidden face inside.

Very Commented, and i believe is easy to understand.
 
### More Info
 
Image Files

It uses all 16.7 billion colors to determine depth, with white highest and black lowest. All of my samples are greyscale just because it is easier to gradient through the spectrum.

If you do it too long you might get a headache!
